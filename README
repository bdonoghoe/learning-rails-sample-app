This is the sample application for the Learning Rails free online course in Ruby on Rails.

See http://www.learningrails.com for more information.

The code currently assumes Rails 2.0.2 and associated gems/plugins. It may work with newer versions, but is problematic with Rails 2.3.x for sure. We are working on some updates.
